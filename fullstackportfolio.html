      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Soloman Tamang, a passionate and aspiring full stack developer who believes in the power of learning, perseverance, and building meaningful things with code. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology connects people and transforms lives. My journey into web development started with curiosity and grew into a dedicated pursuit of mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>
      <p>I aspire to create impactful and user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems. For me, coding is not just a skill—it's a form of expression and creativity. Every error I fix and every new concept I learn fuels my motivation to keep going.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">1. What is Full Stack Development?</h2>
      <p>Full stack development involves working with both the front-end and back-end portions of a web application. A full stack developer is capable of handling all aspects of web development including UI/UX design, server-side logic, database management, and API integrations. Common stacks include the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.</p>
      <p>Example: In a sample project, I created a task manager that allows users to register, log in, and manage their to-do lists. The front end was built using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, while the back end used Node.js and MongoDB for data storage.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">2. HTML</h2>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure for web content. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and containers which are styled and enhanced by CSS and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Practical Use: I’ve used HTML to structure web pages for portfolio sites and blogs, including image galleries and contact forms.</p>
      <div class="code-block">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
  &lt;head&gt;<br>
    &lt;title&gt;My First Page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
  &lt;/head&gt;<br>
  &lt;body&gt;<br>
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my page&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
  &lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">3. CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the appearance of HTML elements. It helps you apply styles like colors, fonts, margins, and responsive layouts to create visually appealing pages.</p>
      <p>Practical Use: I styled a photo gallery using CSS Grid and Flexbox to make it responsive and visually consistent across devices.</p>
      <div class="code-block">
body {<br>
  background-color: #f4f4f4;<br>
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;<br>
  color: #333;<br>
  line-height: 1.6;<br>
}
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">4. Bootstrap Framework</h2>
      <p>Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that simplifies the development of responsive web pages. It provides pre-built components like grids, navbars, modals, buttons, and cards using simple class names.</p>
      <p>Practical Use: I used Bootstrap to build a mobile-friendly landing page with a navigation bar, image carousel, and feature cards in just a few hours.</p>
      <div class="code-block">
&lt;button class="btn btn-success"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;<br>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info"&gt;This is an alert box!&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">5. JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity to web pages. It can manipulate HTML/CSS, handle user inputs, validate forms, and make asynchronous calls to servers (AJAX).</p>
      <p>Practical Use: In a portfolio site, I used JavaScript to build a contact form validator and a light/dark mode toggle feature to enhance user experience.</p>
      <div class="code-block">
&lt;script&gt;<br>
  function greet() {<br>
    alert('Hello, welcome to my portfolio!');<br>
  }<br>
&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;button onclick="greet()"&gt;Greet Me&lt;/button&gt;
